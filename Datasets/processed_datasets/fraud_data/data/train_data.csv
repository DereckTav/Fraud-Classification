"The Gardus RLE200 LintEater system is a fantastic investment for homeowners tired of expensive dryer vent cleaning services. After struggling with frequent $75 service calls due to a poorly routed vent, this kit allowed me to easily and effectively clean out years of accumulated lint, restoring my dryer's efficiency and saving me money in the long run. The system is easy to use, even with challenging vent layouts, and the peace of mind knowing my dryer vent is clean and safe is well worth the price.",5,0,1
It's a long hose. It transports water from the spigot to the place you want it to go. Isn't effective for whipping people or otherwise. Too heavy to swing it that way. Will kink but not often. No holes found in it except for the ones on either end. Water arrives at desired location as expected.,5,0,0
"This pressure cooker is a disappointment. While it boasts a solid base and a convenient size for smaller cooking tasks, critical flaws overshadow any positives. The handle remains stubbornly loose despite tightening, the emergency pressure release valve detached during a simple hand wash, and the pressure valve sticks, hindering proper operation. Ultimately, these significant issues with pressure regulation and overall build quality make this a pressure cooker I can't recommend, despite wanting to like it.",2,0,1

"Update: All are now dead. I took a chance on ""Mighty Bright 47017 Recharge Book Light"" mostly because it's head and neck are a continuous flexible silicon piece. The good: No spinning head problem - easily adjustable - seems to have long battery life - much better made than my last mighty bright 40513 The not so good: Neck is a bit short - another inch or so would have been much better. The clip is small - It's been fine for paper backs and medium hard covers not sure it would work for text books or a kindle. About twice the price - (but if it last will actually save cash) ===================================== The Good I really liked this light - the goose neck allows you to move it about with ease and it stays where you put it...doesn't sag like my old ""hinged"" reading light did Light is BRIGHT yet doesn't seem to spill further than my book Clamp works on both paper backs and hard covers The BAD: the first one (2012) I bought ended up with a HEAD (the part where the bulbs are) that was so loose it spun about....that was after about a year...eventually I got sick of that and ordered another, just this past Sept (2015)....the plastic was much cheaper looking and the color less to my liking (got purple both times) but the WORST part was the on/off button stopped working after about 3 months : AND the battery compartment cover Always popped off : ( I am debating if the third time will be the charm - or if I need to look elsewhere Update - taped the head on the 2012 purchase - looks funky but works - don't think I'll take a chance and another one of these",1,1,0
"The color I chose according to the color options was ""natural white,"" which the pictures also showed that I was ordering a creamy-white color, but the color I received was ""white."" Also the sizes are in women's not men's, and I ordered according to men's sizes, therefore it is way too small for me. Normally when you buy converse they are bought in men's sizes, and this is not the case, so order according to your actual size if you are a woman, and be weary of the color choices. Otherwise the shoes are legitimately Converse",2,0,0
"This vacuum is a decent option for hard floors, offering adequate suction and maneuverability. However, a significant design flaw hinders its overall usability. The extensions lack a secure locking mechanism, resulting in frequent detachments during use. This constant interruption to reattach the hose and extensions is frustrating and time-consuming. While it gets the job done on hard surfaces, the lack of secure connections makes it unlikely I'll repurchase this model; my next vacuum will definitely prioritize a reliable locking system for the extensions.",3,1,1

"This camp storage box is a solid choice for scout camping, as it handily contains all the essentials for both weekend trips and longer summer camps. While its generous size provides ample storage and even doubles as a camp seat, its lack of wheels and a handle become noticeable when hauling it long distances, especially from parking areas to campsites. Adding those features would truly make it the perfect, all-in-one camping companion.",4,1,1

Good value. 09/01/17 Cancelled my subscription. Magazine has gotten to be more advertizing than articles. Used to love this magazine but I have been going thru when it first arrives and tear out all of the prescription medication and other advertizine pages. Just nothing left in the magazine at all.

"This album is a mixed bag for me. While I appreciate the band's energy, I'm frustrated by the repetitive tracklist, finding several songs duplicated from their previous releases. However, the real saving grace is their collection of rocking carols, which are surprisingly catchy and far more enjoyable than their standard fare. If you're looking for a fresh perspective on Christmas classics with a hard-rock edge, this is worthwhile; otherwise, you might be better off picking and choosing specific tracks.",3,0,1
"Battery does extend the life of my Samsung S5, but not by as much as I would have hoped. Normal battery lasts about 5 hours, while this battery lasts about 7 hours with normal use.

"I am using this mount for a 27"" LCD in my bedroom. Using a swivel mount with tilt works great for almost any room layout. The black powder-coat paint matches the TV, and looks great. Adjustment and locking is easy with the included hex wrench. I would rate this ""5 stars"" if the mounting screws were better. Made from relatively soft steel, the screw head strips very easily. After ruining one screw, I replaced it with a large black deck screw. It might be advisable to drill small pilot holes before attempting to drive the screws. Word of caution: If you do not drive the proper mounting screws into the center of a wall stud, if you exceed the specified TV weight limit, or if you try to get by with a really cheap swing arm mount, you may be signing a death sentence for your $500 TV (and perhaps yourself)!",4,1,0
"These inserts offered a brief respite from plantar fasciitis pain, providing relief for about three days.

"This product suffers from a serious lack of magnetic strength. The provided magnets are insufficient for holding even lightweight items, forcing me to resort to a DIY fix involving printing clip art and attaching my own magnets.

"Unlike the other Narnia books it seems the children can't take two steps without requiring divine intervention. time and again one of the characters ties to do something completely crazy such as willingly casting a spell which will destroy Narnia (for personal gain) untill Aslan appears in some form to change their minds. I enjoyed all of the other books in the series (would rate them as a 4 - 5), with the exception of the Last battle which having peeked ahead i decided not to finish, as to me it would have been a most depressing end to a great series.",1,1,0
"I've mentioned in my other Munchkin reviews how awesome Munchkin is. It is. Great game. Can't say enough about how much fun the overall game is. Awesome. I can't, unfortunately, repeat that word for Munchkin 6: Demented Dungeons. You won't hear me repeat the word again in this review. This Munchkin expansion introduces two new card types to the game: Dungeons and Portals. Dungeons are cards that are played in a separate stack from the normal two stacks in a typical Munchkin game (the Door stack and the Treasure stack). A Dungeon card represents the dungeon the characters are playing in. There is a Dungeon in play at all times, and each dungeon adds a new rule or new law by which the characters must abide while that dungeon is still in play. Portal cards get dealt into the Door stack, and they're used to change out the dungeon that is currently in play and replace it with a new one. Some Portal cards have their own rules, so that two or three dungeon cards can conceivably be in play at the same time. All this sounds great, and it is in theory. The problem is that there aren't many Portal cards, and when you have a lot of expansion decks in play, that makes for a lot of Door cards. When you have to shuffle the Portal cards into the Door deck, they get diluted significantly in a bigger deck. A big part of the fun with the Dungeon element is to regularly change out the Dungeon (and some of the rules for specific dungeons are less fun than others to live with, so you WANT those changed out quickly). A big deck of cards means you may only encounter a new Portal every once in a while (or occasionally not at all). This leaves you with two options. 1) Deal the Portal cards into the whole big Door deck and hope for the best, knowing that you may not see a Portal card again for most of the game and may get stuck with a Dungeon you don't much care for. 2) After you shuffle the whole big deck of Door cards, shuffle the Portal cards into just the top [insert your favorite fraction here] part of the Door cards. Top half, top third, maybe? This way the Portal cards are mixed in relatively close to the top and are sure to be drawn often throughout the game. The problem with this is that, if you want to continue to do this, you have to go through the deck after every game and pull out all the Portal cards so that they can be shuffled into the top portion of the deck for the next game. Otherwise, they'll be all mixed in after the first time you do this. Option 1 is not much fun when you have 500+ Door cards diluting the handful of Portal cards. Option 2 is a royal pain to deal with before and after every game (but it's great during the game.) If you're working with a smaller deck (my condolences), this may not be such a big deal. After playing with these cards a few times, though, we just leave them in the box now. Not really worth it. In the immortal words of Dennis Miller, though, that's just my opinion; I could be wrong. Munchkin 6 is still good, just not quite as aweso--",3,1,0

"first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",3,1,0

"While the production might offer some entertainment value, historical accuracy seems to be a major casualty. The casting choices are particularly jarring, with Daniels' portrayal of Washington feeling geographically and culturally amiss, reminiscent of a Disney caricature rather than a Virginian leader. Furthermore, the questionable decision to cast Welsh and English actors as Scottish and American figures, respectively, complete with their native accents, further undermines the film's credibility and distracts from any potential narrative strengths. These inaccuracies significantly detract from the overall viewing experience.",1,1,1

"Everyone knows that Velvet Revolver is the super group made up of Slash, Duff McKagan & Matt Sorum from Guns 'N' Roses and lead vocalist Scott Weiland from Stone Temple Pilots with guitarist Dave Kushner throw into the mix. The group's past lives and troubles are well documented, but how does the album sound? The answer is pretty good. Slash provides some superb guitar work and hits you right over the head on the album's opening track ""Sucker Train Blues"" which also features some wicked bass work by Mr. McKagan. The band reaches into their roots, but pumps new life into the veins of songs like the bass heavy ""Big Machine"" and the propulsive ""Slither"". ""Superhuman"" is a rant about illegal substances which stares head-on at Mr. Weiland's checkered past. The album trips up when they get into power ballad territory on tracks like ""Fall To Pieces"" & ""Loving The Alien"". The group seems confined by the tracks. Velvet Revolver is at their best when they go all out and blast supercharged, chunky riffs that on the brink of being out of control.",3,1,0

"We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.",5,0,0

This planned obsolescence makes it a questionable investment, as users can find themselves forced to upgrade to a newer version within a couple of years, negating the initial value.",4,0,1

"Theres no denying that several children enjoy these Naria Tales and that some of them are ingenious - I like the idea of the wardrobe, in the first tale, through which a different time and space is entered, because it is imaginative and points to an awareness of different realities than that which our finite minds can perceive. That having been said, however, I always feel that Louis is trying too hard to preach a message and that his allegorising is too obvious both to the adult reader and to an intelligent child. There are other ways of broadening and enriching children's minds than to give them a slanted metaphor steeped in biblical imagery of lions and apocalyptic battles and all too obvious references to Christ. One day, I must talk to a child who has recently read one of these tales and see how s/he perceives it. I'm all for the 'Tell it slant' approach and I don't find this slanted enough.",2,0,0
"My evaluation is based on my experience with NIS 2002. The only reason I feel obligated to give it two stars is that, when it works, it works very well. (You can ban domains like Doubleclick from accessing your computer at all, and it also blocks ads and intercepts hacking attempts.) However, Symantec's customer support may as well be nonexistent. Its customer and technical support people were recalcitrant and nonresponsive when a Live Update caused a serious problem for me in 2004, and a friend's experience in 2005 shows that the company has changed neither its attitude toward its customers nor its practices. When I replace my computer, I will look for an alternative to anything made by Symantec because I have no respect whatsoever for this company-- an attitude shaped entirely by the company's total lack of respect for the customers who pay for its existence. UPDATE February 24 2006 At this point I wish I had given NIS a one-star rating. Upon attempting to renew my virus definition subscription, I got the following message: "" We're sorry, a subscription renewal is not available for this product. If you currently use Windows XP/2000, please select from the above recommended replacement upgrades."" Upon wading through several Web pages to get technical support, I got the following: ""The versions of Norton Internet Security listed on this page have been discontinued. Therefore, telephone and online support are no longer available."" It seems to me that Symantec has a nice little racket for digging into its customers' pockets: sell them a product and then stop supporting it so they have to buy an upgrade. The best way to deal with this is simply to not buy anything from them whatsoever. Symantec is permanently disqualified from selling me any new software whatsoever (because of the issues described above and also reviews that say the newer versions cause trouble for many people) and this is my recommendation to all prospective and existing customers.",2,0,0

"This dryer vent cleaning kit proved invaluable for tackling a long, convoluted vent system without moving heavy appliances. While I opted for a ""lazy"" approach, cleaning from the outside in and forgoing vacuum assistance, the sturdy rods and brush effectively dislodged and pushed lint through 24 feet of pipe with multiple bends.

"At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.",3,1,0

"As most already know twisted metal is a car combat game collect weapons and destroy your enemies as you drive pretty simple idea that can definitely be fun.... Summary:(Read Below if you wanted More Info) 1= Very good 2=Great! 3= HIt or Miss with the more realistic physics 4= HIt or Miss Imo due to the character design styled more like 1 & 2 than 3 Black=First and Best PS2 Twisted Metal Arguably the best Twisted Metal of All Head On=Good Gameplay Online Mode included (psp and ps2) Spiritual Sequel to Twisted Metal 2 Twisted Metal (2012 for PS3)=Didnt play this one but heard it was good Twisted Metal: A great game, revolutionary for video games of the first 3d era. Still a fun game and the only twisted metal with the inside the car view no saving to memory cards there was a short code for resuming your game later. Twisted Metal 2: Most fans will consider this to be the best twisted metal of all the final release with single track after this one the game changes its physics dramatically... Twisted Metal 3: In this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just wasn't as fun. This was 989 studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like 3 the best. However a few of the early twisted metal fans like 3 better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all. In the end 989 failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiral. Twisted Metal 4: This game still made by 989 studios and after twisted metal 3 alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun. I would say compared to 1 and 2 the default characters you can chose from are less interesting and useful however you can create your own cars. I think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal 4 if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game. This game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was. This is the last twisted metal game for the playstation 1. Twisted Metal Black: First Playstation 2 release and back in the hands of the original creators who reformed under the name Incognito entertainment. Best Graphics easily so far and better than even the game to come after and gameplay thats arguably just or good or better than any of the other games. With nearly as many features as 4 including the first twisted metal game that was online capable(with a special disc not all copies could do that and official servers are shut down now) this game is considered the best by playstation 2 fans and many fans of the twisted metal series. Twisted Metal Head On: This is the spirtual sequel to twisted metal 2 its graphics and gameplay feel like they derived from number 2 however i would not say gameplay is quite as good as number 2 it does have all new stages and solid gameplay with new upgrade system after you kill an opponent you can collect a drop from them to increase your fire power this could be considered better or worse.",3,1,0

I bought this for carrying with me while fishing back wood pools and hunting. I run into thorny vines aka saw brier and the like often often. Safe to say I didn't use this tool heavily at all. First impressions were poor to begin with. Most of the metal was pot metal to begin with. But I didn't return it thinking Fiskars may have cut some corners but maybe not every single one. After a few days of light use it seemed to cut okay. Then after a few days I really had to clamp down to get it to cut small branches. I looked at the edge and noticed it has started curling.

"We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.",5,0,0

It was a Christmas present for my 6 year old son and he loves it. We were up in the mountain and spotted squirrels and birds. Very easy for him to use the binocular. Only downside is the lens cap. They don't fit that great. It easily pop offs. All the lens cap. So they need to fix that for the future. But the binocular it self works fine.

"Gorilla glue might be very strong but it is not user friendly for woodworking. It has some major drawbacks. It is not water soluble so you cannot wipe the excess with a wet rag (I had to use lacquer thinner). It expands quite a bit which means even if you wipe the excess initially, you are still going to have it coming out of the joint. Don't even think about using it to glue anything without using clamps, as the expansion of the glue will cause the parts to move. The bottle cap is cheap and it broke at the bottle when I tried to pull off the cap (which of course glued itself to the nozzle). I've gone back to conventional woodworking glues and the new ones (tite-bond) are very strong so there is no real advantage to Gorilla glue.",1,0,0

"My 4yr old border collie male just LOVES his lamb chop, I'd give dog like ability of you a 5* rating. Samson has dozens of toys and he likes to pic a toy for the day. Lamb chop is that toy 50% of that time, until, I had to take it away to the hospital for surgery(meaning, I have to sew it up). I gave Samson this for 2015 Christmas and he loved his lamb chop instantaneously. The reason for the 2 star rating? It's for the type of material used for lamb chops face and front feet. It's made out of a knit, sock like material that tore very easily. Samson does t tear up his toys anymore. Though he does play rough with them. He had lambchop less than 2 weeks when I noticed the first holes in the knit material on one foot, soon holes in the knit material on its face followed, soon after that, the other foot developed holes. In less than a month the holes in his face knit material had multiplied to point stuffing fell out. That's when I took lambchop away. Oh, after first hole in lambchops face, Samson found where the insidesqueaker was and was working towards it, so I reached in and removed squeakers. I'm sad that they used such a stupid material for its face and front legs. Usually when a seam copes undone, (which is usuall the case when his babies need to go to hospital), I just get out some upholstery thread and a needle and sew it shut. The way this knit material is, I'm at a loss as how to repair his toy. This toy would make an awesome baby toy minus the squeaker but a lousy puppy toy or any dog that has teeth and actually plays with his toys. Obviously whoever designed toy with this knit material hasn't a clue about how dogs play with their toys. I wouldn't recommend this toy to any dog owner due to the knit material tears so easily, even with normal play. I found another lamb toy that Samson just loves, it's one of kong' s lambs. After a couple of months, the face seam did come apart but was easily repairable. This toy is too difficult to figure how to repair. Usually when I repair a toy, it does t come apart again where I repair it. This toy though, I know that knit material will keep tearing. Funny thing is, Samson has blunted teeth, they aren't sharp, so it makes me wonder what would happen with this toy with a dog with sharp teeth....",2,1,0

Personally, I suspect there are some memory leaks somewhere in the software, as my machine is unresponsive to the point of being unusable after a full system scan. I went to an AV suite after running without one for years, but finally got hit with a virus that required reflashing and a ground-up rebuild.

"I went in to Syphon Filter with high hopes and was somewhat dissapointed. While the levels are large and fairly well designed, the quite average graphics caused problems when you get close to surfaces. The games controls also suffer from problems, mostly in terms of the targeting function, which is useful for quick aiming in tight spaces, or when an enemy is moving fast, yet will often aim for enemies you can't hit, when you are being shot at by ones you can, or even aim behind you, throwing the camera into wild spinning and throwing your character out of control. Fortunately auto-aiming removes the necessity of using targeting in most circumstances. In some places, infinately respawning enemies will cause a great deal of frustration (just to be fair, I did set off an alarm, but still...). Some puzzles are good without being [dumb] and contrived, but some were just plain stupid, especially one early in the game where some explosives you just happen to need are hidden in a box in a dark corner of the level. Some triggered events (especially spawning) are odd, for example, on one level, if you haven't completed a certain objective, you will die without much explaination.[...] While these flaws greatly detracted from my playing experience, The story is fairly good, certain levels are very fun, and the game hardly ever throws anything so hard that it's agrivating at you. One battle with a helicopter is a little bit overwhelming, although the hardest part comes at the end of the battle when you have to remember to take off your targeting to hit some enemies. Overall, Syphon Filter is a great game executed poorly, but I have high hopes for the sequal. I hope I'm not let down again.",3,0,0

The bowl is difficult to line up and click into place, the blades's anchor is light cheap plastic and if I let it run for even an extremely short amount of time (say, to chop a few nuts) it starts overheating and a burning smell ensues. I would say that it's only use would be for extremely light chopping jobs or perhaps making mayonaise or salad dressings.

"This doesn't foam all that dramatically, but it does work up a good lather. I know it's just psychological, but the lather really helps me feel like my face is getting clean. And this does a really good job of getting rid of excess oil, makeup, and the like. The exfoliation is gentle but you can definitely feel it. (I'm unsure which ingredient is responsible for the exfoliation, though the Bliss site says ""synthetic spheres"" which probably means polyethylene microbeads.) This has been non-drying and the scent is light, pleasant, and non-irritating (also it doesn't linger after you rinse your face). It is easy to rinse this off and it leaves no residue. Here are the ingredients since I didn't see them on the product page: Water (Aqua/Eau), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Triethanolamine , Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyethylene, Methylparaben, Fragrance (Parfum), Propylparaben, Methylisothiazolinone, PEG-12 Glyceryl Distearate, Blue 1 (CI 42090), Matricaria Leaf Extract, Citric Acid, Glucosamine, Passiflora Incarnata Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Rosa Canina Leaf Extract, Silybum Marianum Seed Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8. So this does have some ingredients that people typically avoid (fragrances, artificial colors, parabens, and sulfates). I really don't have a problem with parabens (they keep bacteria from growing in your cleansers...) or sulfates (really good for lathering/foaming, and without SLS, this probably wouldn't foam). So far, the fragrance and dye have not irritated my skin. For what it's worth, this is probably not vegan because most glucosamine used in industry comes from animal sources. This paragraph is not intended to warn anyone away who was thinking of trying this, because you need to make up your own mind about what ingredients you will use. I was just trying to provide the details needed for you to make the right (informed) decision for yourself. That being said, this appears to contain plastic microbeads (polyethylene from the ingredients list). These are damaging to natural water systems and aquatic life and are difficult to remove during water treatment procedures (they are small here, but they have a tendency to aggregate in nature). Several states are already implementing bans of these beads. I received this in a beauty bag purchase and I will use it up since I already have it and since it is a good cleanser, but I wouldn't buy it again.",3,1,0

"93 Snazzes on the 100 Point Snazz-O-Scale! An excellent and original adaption. An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression. -An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future. -Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes. ""Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone."" ""Thank God,"" Slade responds. ""It's worse,"" Latham says. A short while later Slade says ""But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!"" ""Evil isn't just what you do,"" Latham replies, ""It's also what you DON'T do."" A wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him. -As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged. -Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet. -The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. ""Did you read that book, Mister Slade?"" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed. ""The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?"" ""Humbug?""",5,1,0

"My wife and I used this (finally) at the beach today when the weather was incredible (also finally). The beach is only about a 15 minute walk from the house and sadly I bought the wrong item on Amazon, so we didn't have any ice for the cooler. We didn't have much to bring, so there were some cheese sticks, pretzels, etc. and some sodas in there. It got a little heavy and the handle starts to sting your hand a bit, but it didn't creak or give me any impression that it was going to bend or break in any way - I'd rather have a little hand discomfort than have a cooler break on the first outing. Even without ice, the cooler stayed pretty darn cold, and even about an hour and a half later, our drinks were still pretty cool and pleasant to drink. I'm assuming that they'll be even better when I order the right thing next time and we have ice packs in there. If you're looking for a cooler to hold drinks upright, sadly, this isn't it. The few bottles of soda we brought had to be placed on their sides, so definitely no 2-liters, bottled sodas, or beers will stand upright in this cooler. Cans will be fine. The little button on the top of the lid opened the cooler easily, but I can foresee sand or something getting stuck in there and making opening the lid a little challenging, or the button giving out after many uses. So far that hasn't happened, so the 5-star rating remains. I'll update this review if anything changes, but for now, my wife and I are very pleased with this cooler and look forward to taking it out again during our beach trips this summer (and hopefully many more)!",5,0,0

"As is par for the course in Crichton novels, human beings have created a new advance in science/technology without seriously pondering the consequences. This time the culprit is nanotechnology; microcomputers with a malevolent will of their own. Crichton does a good job of throwing together a mix of different characters and the relationships/tensions between them. It was this very tension that compelled me to keep turning the pages. The science is fascinating too. Most of us are familar with the menacing image of the ""Terminator"" cyborgs which are machines that are bigger and stronger than humans. In this case though, humans are pitted against machines that are microscopic, yet still pose an existential threat to humanity. Crichton's description of the behavior of the machines relative to humans as predator/prey always made me feel like the humans were being stalked and hunted and kept the pace of the book moving briskly. A few years back I read an article in the Los Angeles Times by Bill Joy, Chief Science Officer at Sun Microsystems, about the advances and dangers in nanotechnology. Prey is a book that illustrates those dangers in vivid fashion and should gives us pause to question the wisdom of rushing forward with computer technology at breakneck speed without adequate deliberation.",4,1,0
"These ""squeaker-less"" stuffy toys are a bit of a misnomer. While advertised as having removable squeakers accessible via velcro, I couldn't locate the velcro opening intended for squeaker removal in the head as described. Instead, I found a velcro seam that led only to an empty compartment. My dog, aiming for the ever-elusive hypothetical squeaker, immediately began trying to dismantle the toy, defeating the purpose of a supposedly squeaker-free experience. It's a durable-seeming stuffy, but not quite what I was expecting.",3,0,1

"In ""An Apple a Day"" the McGill University professor Joe Schwarcz offers salient useful nutritional advice. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Meat is fine but make sure you have more whole grains on your plate. Emphasize variety and balance in your diet. Avoid processed foods, especially those high in fat, sugar, and salt. Exercise. There are no miracle foods and short cuts to a healthy diet. That's great advice that comes at page 353 of this 355-page book. I have many issues with the structure of the book, the main being Dr. Schwarcz's decision to divide his book into easily digestible chapters tackling all the major food debates out there: organic, genetically modified, detox, and so on. It would have been a much better book if Dr. Schwarcz structured it around his main thesis: that there are no short cuts to a healthy diet. Science has spent decades and billions of dollars analyzing the different components of food in the hope of distilling the magical qualities of apples and tomatoes, and selling it in a bottle. There is no scientific basis for the overwhelming superiority of a certain vitamin, chemical, or nutritional supplement. Quite the opposite: eating or drinking too much of a good thing can be a bad thing. Seeking balance, moderation, and variety in nutrition is the best and only path to good health.",2,1,0

It was the perfect city and my whole population (who still liked by the way) left the city. If you have a good reason for it , I'd say it was a glitch in the game. Don't get me wrong, it is a fun game when there is a reason to the sudden drops, but I don't think you can have a real good city that lasts for more than four or five hours and there is no good city, they'll all die out eventually.

"I read this book aloud to my children. It is a re-read for me, but I was only nine years old when I first read it. I never did finish the entire Chronicles of Narnia, so now I am reading the series with my children. I am tickled pink to report that the book still hasn't lost its magic some 30+ years later! Although I have only read the first two books in the series, it was The Magician's Nephew that was my favourite rather than the more popular second in the series, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The book is about a boy named Digory, whose uncle is somewhat of a magician. He creates these rings (one yellow and one green) that, when touched, will transport someone to an in-between world that is tranquil and calm but filled with numerous pools all leading to different worlds! Uncle Andrew tricks Digory's friend, Polly, into touching one of the rings, and she is whisked away before Digory's eyes. The only problem is that Polly does not possess the green or ""home"" ring to bring her back. And therein lies the rub. Digory has no choice but to follow Polly into the great unknown with two green rings so that they can both return home. It turns out that the rings do not quite work in the way that Uncle Andrew believed that they did, but I will let you discover how they work on your own! Narnia fans debate on how to read the series: One is in the order of publication, and the other is chronologically. The Magician's Nephew was actually the sixth book in the series to be published, and it was The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe that was published first. In my opinion, by not reading The Magician's Nephew first, you will miss out on pertinent information, such as: How Narnia was created, the significance of the light post in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the identity of the Professor and the White Witch in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and how the wardrobe was made. Lewis himself expressed a preference for the chronological order and wrote to an American boy named Laurence in 1957 the following: ""I think I agree with your order {i.e. chronological} for reading the books more than with your mother's. The series was not planned beforehand as she thinks. When I wrote The Lion I did not know I was going to write any more. Then I wrote P. Caspian as a sequel and still didn't think there would be any more, and when I had done The Voyage I felt quite sure it would be the last. But I found as I was wrong. So perhaps it does not matter very much in which order anyone read them. I'm not even sure that all the others were written in the same order in which they were published."" Re-reading this book as an adult, I now see the Biblical parallels in The Magician's Nephew that I never noticed as a child. It is certainly a book that is meant to be read again and again, and it does not lose its lustre! I love the book even more now as an adult than I did as a child, if that is even possible!! My children loved the book as well and cannot believe that they are reading Mommy's original box set from 1980. MY RATING: 5 stars!! Highly recommended for young and old alike! If you haven't read the series since you were a child, you should read it again! You will discover new things that you didn't notice previously.",5,0,0

"This trigger lock works well as advertised on firearms with fixed trigger guards, providing a secure locking mechanism. However, its effectiveness is severely limited on lever-action rifles. While it can be made to work with some effort on a Winchester 94, on a Winchester 9422 it proves largely ineffective due to its tendency to slip off the trigger during lever operation, rendering it useless for preventing the firearm from being loaded and cocked. Consider alternative locking solutions for lever-action firearms.",2,0,1

"I was super worried when I ordered this that the color would be too pinky for my reddish toned skin but this has a really nice tint to it. I use Vincent Longo Water Base before application. I tried three ways to use this: Once with a foundation brush (which was awkward) and then with a dry sponge, finally with a damp sponge ( I used a face cloth to take most of the water out of it). The best application was with a lightly damp sponge. This provides a light coverage and if you are looking for something heavier, this probably won't work for you. I can see that this will be amazing for summer when I have a bit more oil in my very dry skin. I did really like how this felt (super light) and how it looked once I got the hang of a good application. I normally use a liquid foundation so this was a bit of a change for me.",4,1,0

"This trigger lock proved to be highly inconsistent across different firearms. While it fit snugly on my Mossberg 500, it was incompatible with my AR-15 (Stag Model 1) and only a partial fit on my Savage Model 11.

"Died after 4 months. Colors are wayyyy off when compared with a higher quality monitor. The monitor is very dark colored overall, even tweaking in the gpu driver couldn't compensate the colors enough - one of the colors (green channel) just isn't bright enough to balance without the screen so dark you can't see it. When you have a window open you can see vertical and horizontal lines across the screen from the window to the monitor edges. You can clearly see flickering when there is something semi-bright displayed. Power supply is the size of a brick. Very poor monitor - it's good for the screen space, but I would not pay more than $100 for this if I had seen just how pathetic it is. ** EDIT a few days later ** So plugging it back in to take pictures of the tiling artifacts, and now suddenly it works fine. I'm guessing the monitor overheated? Anyway, now I'm nervous the monitor will die while I'm using it (again). Also for those that will suggest the GPU - other monitors worked fine on the same card / dual-link bypass mode. Spent a good hour reseating gpus and different combinations. The monitor was definitely dead, and now a few days later, it's alive. Unfortunately... this means it will randomly die mid-use again. Also the color issue, I had that backwards. The green channel is way too high on this monitor. You have to turn the green channels to max and lower the other channels to match other higher quality monitors to this one. (I still can't match the white mix, close enough seems to be about +50 green to match HP and Dell) Still gets 1* for: horrid, dull color brightness lines flickering and mostly, it randomly dies. ** EDIT 2015/08/23 (purchased Oct. 2014) ** Monitor occasionally does not come on. I have to physically detach power for several minutes, then it seems to work fine again. ** EDIT 2015/10/09 ** Went out during use and had to leave it unplugged for 10 minutes before the display would come back. Horrible purchase",1,0,0
"I've used Apex hoses for 15yrs plus, but after having been so disappointed with the Never Kink (always kinks) series. I went with a rubber / vinyl from ACE that I really liked - except until if failed after only 2 seasons by internally leaking between the exterior rubber jacket and the vinyl liner and then morphing into a python before developing several pin hole leaks all on its own within a week. I enjoy landscaping and gardening, so I need good garden hose function of yore (10yrs+ ago before ,more corporation mergers and lesser quality outsourced imports). So I went back to Apex for this 8509 - which is far from heavy duty in my experience. Hose is surprisingly lightweight and although 5/8"" has never overcome it's shipping slightly collapsed oval shape after hours in the sun and under 80lbs + city water pressure. As other reviews have pointed out - the bib end is nice heavy machined brass, but the service end is lightweight thin brass. Pros - Lifetime Warranty and good telephone support from Apex. Doesn't hang or catch on things as easily as a rubber exterior hose. Might be better suited as a reel hose or for someone who would appreciate the lighter weight for maneuvering. Cons -1) Kinks by just looking at it (or seems to) when pulling it to a new location. I must be very careful to unwind as I pull after being carefully coiled in 4' diameter. 2) Doesn't flow as much water as my previous 5/8"" 100' rubber vinyl hose.",2,1,0

"I bought a new Vista computer a little over a year ago. It came with a ""Easy"" Media Creator 9 teaser. I bought the upgrade to Creator 10 ""because it was Vista-compatible"". Yeah, sure. After finding it to be trash, I set it aside for a year. Then I went back to get a software update. Would you believe a 1,500 MB download? The updated version does not do what I want it to do. I open the Video Converter and it takes quite a while to open. But if you wait it out you can click on Add Movies and a malformed screen opens with some text partially obscured. The hourglass cursor comes up and nothing happens again. No error message, just a sickening view of crapware. I'll be uninstalling this garbage and replacing it with several small programs from companies that have software support in case I have problems. I'm tired of small companies becoming large companies that lose track of what the customer wants.

"After installing it occurred to me that perhaps the little membrane patches are meant to be overlaid with a real rubber patch. But since there's no adhesive on tops it doesn't quite computer. Buffed the area well and Applied the first patch to a small well-defined puncture in the tube, installed it into the tire and put it aside for a while. In an hour the tire was flat. Repeated the process and forcefully stitched down the little membrane patch as hard as I could, rolling between my fingers. Reinflated to 60-actually 50 pounds per square inch and set it aside for 24 hours. Tested the pressure and got a reading of 50. Took the mtn. bike on a 5 mile riide on hard surfaces at speeds up to 25 on descent. Pressure held steady.

Our BG Macaw did not destroy this right away. Big chunky wood - Edit: For some reason my BG just ended up ignoring this.

"After spending close to $400 on these white lights from this seller on eBay, I can confidently say that they are not worth the investment. The lights themselves are subpar in quality, with a flimsy construction that does not instill confidence in their durability. The brightness is also disappointing, as they do not emit as much light as similarly priced options from other sellers. Additionally, the customer service from this seller was less than satisfactory, with slow response times and a lack of willingness to rectify the situation.

I used it for about a total of one to two hours a day on my commute. There was just one drawback, and it was a deal-breaker for me. I wear glasses, and the bulk of the headset behind the ear made it very uncomfortable. I returned the headset today after I had to end my call on the way home after 20 minutes.

"Ok, just got this baby today and tested it out. Maybe someone commented in older reviews but I didn't see the following notes in the newer ones. What I discovered is the following: It does turn off after going over the ""hump"" but you need to have the hose continue going straight at least as long as the tractor is or it will fall over. AND you have to have the hose tightly screwed on to the tractor or the water will leak out the connnection once it is ""off"". It uses a LOT of water. It will give a good thorough soak but at the expense of a very long time and lots of water. So not a good everyday watering tool. It is SLOW - when people mention hours, they were not kidding. But again, you get a good soaking. I've done a yard at a minor angle and it worked fine. If you need to water an area that is irregular you will be fiddling with it for a while. Lastly, if you have a shorter hose you can stop it mid way and pull the hose through from the already done part the tractor is dragging to get lots more space covered without having to set it up again.",4,0,0

"Like the previous Motorola phones that I've had, this one has the easy intutive system for navigating its numerous menus --- I'm sold on using Motorola for this reason, compared to the Noxxxx, Motorola is great! PROS: Almost everything Awesome design GSM I found the volume to be excellent compared to my last phone (motorola v60). Good antenna, extremely low rate of dropped signals --- also, since the antenna does not protrude, I anticipate it will not require replacement (I had to replace the antenna twice on my old v60 --- broke off from carrying in pocket and/or dropping) Excellent color screen. Good camera for a phone. Great size, easily fits in a shirt pocket. Great battery life (with Bluetooth off) Easily customizable but items that I never use (media mall, media net, etc.) remain in a prominent place and can not be put in some obscure location. CONS: The most significant negative feature is the screen --- it is extremely hard to see in sunlight. Display on front (when closed) is hard to read. Price (if you are upgrading your phone with Cingular --- they wanted $199) However, since I was changing from AT&T to Cingular I was able to buy the phone at BestBuy for $70. The manual that comes with it should be better writen. Screen gets oily from normal use and must be wiped off frequently. Alarm Clock interface could be better. Date Book Alert is not very loud. Accessory support at Cingular Stores rather poor --- two Cingular Stores did not have the USB cable (had to buy one at Wal-Mart). Of the four or five phones that I have owned, this one is by far the best in all respects. Even with these cons it is still eons ahead of other phones. EDIT: Change from 5 stars to 1 star... I loved the features on the phone and the flip lid was great. PROBLEM: After about 3 months the screen would not light up --- took the phone back to AT&T and they sent me a reconditioned phone which lasted about a month --- took that one back, they sent another reconditioned phone, Long story > short: I had 5 phones in one year, the 5th phone finally worked and kept working for a couple of years.

"I've been running OS X on my G4 Powerbook for over a year now, and I love it. Jaguar 10.2.8 was running great so there was no stability reason for me to upgrade. Basically I just had to have the latest version just because it is the latest type of thing. Yes the system is quicker and there are some useful features such as expose, but I'm not sure it was worth the cost of the upgrade. If Apple is planning on upgrading OS X every year then I probably could have gone along with 10.2.8 with no complaints and done a upgrade on the next version. I think Apple should have offered a upgrade version for those with 10.2 for about half the cost of what is charged for Panther. To pay full price for a OS you expect major changes, like from Windows 98 to Windows XP. So if you are happy with 10.2 and the new features in 10.3 are not something you need then I would stay with your current version and see what comes along next year. If you just have to have the lastest version no matter what then pick it up and you won't be disapointed.",4,0,0

Usually I LOVE Orange Circle products and I was looking for an extended 2017 monthly planner with note pages and a folder for all my loose papers I end up with by the end of the day. FIRST this wasn't a big deal to me but would be a HUGE DEAL to someone else... there are no week per page views as stated in the description!!!! As for me... my biggest peeve and the reason I have to return this is it says it comes with a ""handy"" pocket. Handy it most certainly isn't. I'd be lucky to fit 2 pages in it folded in half, plus everything you try to put in it gets snagged on the back layer of the pocket since it's essentially just a tight folder pocket glued to the back page (If it expanded maybe i'd have kept it, but I think they were trying to keep it slim-lined and rendered it useless for me). Also considering the large size compared to the thinness and the fact that they say it'd be great in a purse etc. I was surprised at how flimsy it felt and could imagine it would get pretty beat up over the course of 17 months.

The nook wouldnt let me do it anywhere but a Barnes and Nobles store so I didn't get to use it for almost 2 weeks.

They appoligized but wouldnt be putting the money back for 5 days. Since this was cash money they took off my debit card I was just out for days...wonder what would have happened if Id bought 10 books? The nook seems to work great now that I can use it, but using barnes and noble for you ebooks might not be the best idea. They admitted they were having a problem with the double dipping and were trying to fix it. I had it happen 2 years ago when I ordered on line to have paper backs sent to me.

A very quick overview of the different aspects of prepping that need to be considered however with very little in depth coverage of any one subject.

Don't get me wrong, the subjects the author covers are important, especially for the newbie prepper, and it's a good motivational tool to get started. But this book really could be written by anyone who spent a few hours on the internet doing some research about prepping. I wouldn't spend more than about $5 for this book.

"We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.",5,0,0

The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"There are some historical inaccurracies in this film, to be sure. The Wikipedia entry for the movie has most of them. And like most movies dealing with any war, there are not enough men on the screen to portray the actual number of soldiers involved. Washington had more than 2000 troops when he went into Trenton, up against about the same number of Hessians. Of course, without computer-generated graphics, there's no way a made-for-television movie can portray that. I have to question the casting of Jeff Daniels as Washington. I know Washington was a flesh and blood person, but somehow Daniels (or perhaps the script he had to work with) does not communicate the gravitas that must have personified Washington. This was a man chosen practically unanimously by the Continental Congress to lead the army. Daniels does not come across as that sort of person. Although it is known that Washington had a temper, especially in extremis, most of the time Daniels' Washington comes across as merely petulant or even bitchy. The dialogue between most of the characters seemed at times to be pretty anachronistic. American screenwriters should take a lesson from their British counterparts (Andrew Davies, for example) on how to write 18th Century dialogue that sounds authentic but not stilted or phoney. Finally, THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. We watched it with our 7 and 9 year olds because they're studying the Revolution in school. We were dismayed by the bad language, sexual references and the over-the-top bloodletting. Why did the director think it a good idea to show closeups of bayoneting and swords going all the way through people? Showing it is one thing -- but closeups? C'mon! At least the DVD should have indicated what's in store so parents could be informed.",4,0,0

It is a classic study in manufacturing failure and will snap like glass the first time you use it. Someone at SOG (or, more likely, one of their components vendors) couldn't be bothered to consider what happens when you stamp lettering right at a stress concentration point then harden a bit that will be subjected to considerable torsion (note in the picture that the crack follows the letter ""A""). SOG's own parts listing is full of complaints about this and of course these aren't covered by the warranty. If this is an example of their engineering or quality control, I can't wait to see what happens next. You can read the reviews on SOG's own web site by searching ""Phillips screwdriver"" I'm sorry, but there are just too many good tools by good manufacturers out there to be a repeat customer for this kind of negligence.",1,1,0

"This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint. - OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!",5,0,0

I've never written a bad review before but this mattress is so bad that I feel that I must. I bought this a few months ago and kept it in it's package in the garage. I was very excited to use it for camping over the weekend and couldn't believe that it lost all of it's air by the middle of the night. I only weigh 107 pds so I know it wasn't my weight.

"This movie is easily on my top-5 list of the worst films I have ever seen. The painful truth of the matter is that I saw this in the theater. What a horrible memory that is! I am a 33-year-old male, and in my entire life I have never wanted to leave the movie-house as badly as I wanted to while watching this pile of rubbish. I have never walked out on any movie, much to my dismay. I should have left during this one. In fact, I remember at least 4 people leaving the theater, never to return. One scene, in particular, haunts me to this very day. There is a complex conspiracy afoot, and the villains all meet one last time before the crime will unfold. They decide to wear disguises to conceal their identities. They are all dressed in giant, multi-colored Teddy Bear costumes!!! What? Yes, you read it correctly. It is so incredibly stupid that I have a hard time retelling it without my lower intestine reaching up and strangling my brain.

"Motorcycle enthusiasts are a unique breed and the main quality that sets them apart from the rest of civilization is their unyielding enthusiasm for their chosen sport/hobby. They often become consumed with biking and, like golf fanatics and others, they view every spare moment as an excuse to partake in their chosen activity. Cycle World is a magazine designed with the motorcycle enthusiast in mind. This publication is made for the type of biker who not only likes to ride his cycle, but also liked to learn as much about motorcycles as possible. There are, of course, plenty of articles in each issue of Cycle World that talk about the joys of riding and the sport of motorcycle racing. But Cycle World includes other articles, too- articles that only the well- rounded motorcycle fan will be likely to read and appreciate. Some articles focus on new technology. Others dispense advice on motorcycle repair. There are also travel articles and personality profiles as well, making for a nicely rounded publication. I'm not a motorcycle enthusiast or even a casual fan, but I still like certain sections of Cycle World and I try to read a few of them every month. My favorite sections of Cycle World are those that feature new products. Cycle World is among the first publications to report on new motorcycles and other related products and the magazine includes plenty of great photos, test data, and various statistics. In a matter of minutes, one can quickly learn the pros and cons of a specific motorcycle and more easily make a buying decision. Even though I am not a fan, I still like these articles because, like articles on new cars, they often include some very cool new product offerings that can easily impress anyone- even a nonfan like me. Motorcycles are loved by their many enthusiastic fans and Cycle World is a magazine intended for those who want a well- rounded publication about motorcycles, their upkeep, and their use for entertainment. Most of the pages in each issue are dedicated to the different motorcycles produced by different manufacturers, but there is plenty other information to be found in this magazine about motorcycles and Cycle World makes a good choice for those who want to know how to ride, repair, and enjoy their hobby as much as possible.",4,1,0

"Green eggs and ham, as a recolorized staple breakfast food, captures the reader's attention by turning this diurnal sustenance into an unexpected and apparently unappetizing foodstuff. It thus symbolizes the existential angst of modern life, wherein we are unfulfilled by modern life, and are repelled by something that might impart nourishment. The ""protagonist"" to be convinced of its desirability remains anonymous, while the other actor refers to himself with an emphatic identifier ""Sam I am"", formed with a pronominal subject and copular verb of existence. This character thus seeks to emphasize his existence and existential wholeness, and even establish a sense of self-existence, with an apparent Old Testament allusion to Elohim speaking to Moses as the ""I Am"". This emphatic personal identifier thus introduces a prominent theme of religious existentialism to the narrative, probably more in line with original Kierkegaardian religious existentialism, rather than later forms of existentialism that were less theocentric and more nihilistic and darker. The anonymity of the protagonist speaks of his lack of personal existential identity or lack of spiritual fulfilment that results from his pursuit of ordinary modern life. The modernistic lifestyle requires, prescribes, and enforces standard, conventionalized modes of thought, such as insisting on standard eggs and ham, and deeming deviations from the norm as distasteful and to be avoided, a pirori, even though pursuit of non-orthodox forms of meaning in modern society might actually lead one to the fulfilment that one might be seeking as a lonely, nameless person. One might benefit from embracing the unconventional, but modern society has taught us to simply accept what everyone else likes and accepts and values, and we are unable to find happiness outside of the lonely conventional framework that the modern world imposes upon us. Thus, we are nameless, devoid of identity, and unable to see that the unconventional might actually impart meaning and joy to our otherwise mundane and futile existence. In various mythologies, eggs denote fertility, and thus, new life and rebirth. Ham may indicate a strong source of nourishment and gustatory pleasure, but also, what was once ceremonially forbidden under older religious codes, but is now allowable (it is not clear to me if this change in religious dietary restrictions is a relevant part of the existential analogy that the author is attempting to convey, though). Both are rendered as green - verdant, the color of spring, life, nature, and growth. The religious symbolism is very apparent here, and perhaps also the author is playing with Jungian archetypes here to set up the religious existential elements. The food items being offered are not just a physical enjoyment or pursuit, but something of spiritual value, leading to renewal, growth, and sustenance at this higher level of existence. The protagonist rejects this offer outright, not realizing their spiritual benefits, not recognizing the higher level of existence and life to which he is called. He remains confined to the purely physical realm that he knows and understanding, refusing to recognize or embrace what lies beyond the material. The protagonist declares he would not eat them here or there; in a house or with a mouse; in a box or with a fox; in a boat or with a goat; or in other localities or with other modes of transport, such as in a car, in the dark, in a plane, in the rain, and so forth. He rejects the pursuit of this nourishment in various modalities of modern life, in various locales, and in various social settings (with mice, foxes, goats, or even at home alone). The character dismisses pursuit of a lifestyle deemed unorthodox by modern or post-modern society in any locale or social realization. He refuses to think outside the box (""not in a box, not with a fox""), confining himself to his mere material existence. A sort of literary merism is employed here (part-whole metaphors that denote entirety, such as ""day and night"" meaning ""all the time"" in poetry). He excludes the possibility of eating it ""here or there or anywhere"" - an emphatic merism - or an any locality, or any mode of transport, that is, in any path of life, or going about his mundane, meaningless daily routine, he still rejects the offer. In whatever social circle, be it with creatures deemed dirty such as mice, or probably even alone at home - at home by himself in his existential despair, angst, and loneliness, in the location where he is most comfortable and most ""himself"" - he would reject this offer. In doing so, he also rejects the sharing of something substantive and spiritual with other social companions, and would instead prefer to be home or otherwise alone, accepting and (in a philosophically perverse way) enjoying his conventionalized, lonely, angst-driven life that modern society has imposed. Sam continues to offer the unusual, greenish manna, and finally the protagonist relents and tries it. He undergoes a personal epiphany and spiritual transformation. He goes beyond his conventional existence and experiences for the first time an unconventional fulfillment. He has taken an existential leap of faith into something higher and deeper, rejecting hollow social norms and the materialistic values that society offers. He receives the new gift, the new enjoyment, with great joy and enthusiasm, and declare his desire to consume the product anywhere and everywhere, in whatever locale or social context, in whatever path of life (train, car, plane...) he finds himself. Thus, he makes a full commitment to that which lies beyond the material, conventional existence that humans know by nature, and fully and whole-heartedly embraces a radically different set of values and avenue of fulfilment. Sam, as the one constantly offering the new experience, always begging him, always probing for a new situation or context (in boxes or houses, with fox or mice...) in which he might be willing to open his mind, serves a crucial mentor role. In fact, as such, and as one implying a self-existence with ""Sam I Am"", he serves as a literary Christ-figure or Christ-type. The nameless protagonist undergoes a spiritual and existential change, growth, and renewal. As such, he functions as an existential type of hero, one that undergoes an internal spiritual or personal transformation, takes a leap of faith, and finds a greater fulfllment beyond mundane social expectations. As an existential experience, it is perhaps hard for the reader to understand why such chromatically differentiated foodstuffs would become so enjoyable, so worthy of such enthusiastic embrace, that it is something that only one who personally experiences it, such as our hero here, can understand, and can only partially communicate to others. Likewise, the literary Christ-figure Sam could only offer it and express descriptively and experientially, not propositionally, about the desirability of the food items - a benefit that the hero was not capable of understanding or accepting until he himself tried it. This existential leap of faith is perhaps reminiscent of Pascal's wager, wherein Blaise Pascal claimed that sometimes one comes to the point where one cannot accept or psychologically apprehend propositional truth about matters of faith, but one can only take a leap of faith, try faith oneself, try it experientially, before one can actually understand it or come to grips with it, in order to determine its reality and validity.",5,0,0

"I enjoy stories about past lives. I love good historical novels. I have some first hand experience with hypnotic regression. I usually love novels written 20-30 years ago. But not this one. It managed to annoy me on many levels. One could excuse the repeated violent rape scenes, including one perpetrated by the hero, as being characteristic of the 1980s when this book was written, as that was a time before women had finally figured out that a man who says ""I love you"" and then perpetrates a violent rape belongs in prison, not in your bed. One might even excuse as characteristic of the 1980s is the fact that all the protagonists in the story behave like alcoholics, downing what we now would consider volumes of drink that would be diagnosed as binge drinking in just about every scene set in the present. But one one cannot excuse the ridiculous way in which hypnosis and past life regression are presented in this story and the silly way that everyone including supposed medical professionals encourage what would be in real life a psychotic reaction in the heroine. The heroine herself is Too Stupid to Live--the classic dumb heroine who, when warned not to go down into the darkened basement while a killer is on the loose and the power is out, always goes into the basement. If you enjoy that kind of story you'll love this one. If you like your heroine to be slightly brighter than a guinea pig, save your 99 cents and download something else. The worst part of this book is that the writer has enough of a command of style to get you reading this bloated, endlessly long book. So that it isn't until you've gotten more than half way through that you realize just how stupid the plotting is. If you keep reading after that you are rewarded with a completely unbelievable and emotionally unsatisfied ending. Further complaints: The book claims that the history that lies behind the endlessly dull past-life story is well-researched, but any author who puts bubonic plague into a story set in the last decades of the 1100s has NOT done their research. Even in the days before Google mildly educated people knew that the plague first appeared in Europe in 1348. If the book had swept me into an emotionally moving story I would have easily overlooked the innaccuracies, but the emotional interaction between the main characters is wooden and we never get into their heads or feel their reactions, both in the story set in the present and the one in the past. Both are static, with no character undergoing a hint of growth anywhere. The characters are the same on at the end (which felt like page 9000 by the time I got there) as they were in Chapter 1. How this book got to be a bestseller in a world that produced Outlander a few years later is beyond me. Perhaps you had to read it in 1985 to love it, since there do seem to be many readers who did. But reading it in 2012, I certainly didn't. Between the rape scenes and the endless boring interactions between dull English people living what must have been considered a glamorous life in the mid-1980s this book struck me as one that should have remained a fond memory.",1,1,0

"Before reading ""Prey"" (2002), I don't recall having read *any* of Michael Crichton's books as an adult. I'd seen several movies based on his work (""The Andromeda Strain,"" ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Sphere,"" and ""Timeline""), and I knew Crichton created the TV show ""ER,"" which my wife has watched religiously over the years. At first I was a little daunted by the book's 500-plus pages, but Crichton's prose was so easy to read that I just breezed through the entire novel in less than a weekend. While his technological explanations were a little bit repetitive, they successively built on each other, and weren't as obtrusive as the stereotypical ""infodumps"" in ""old-school"" science fiction (""Gosh, Doc, how does that work?"" ""Well, Jimmy, as you already know, the Universal Transmogrifier can easily rearrange matter at the atomic level, using..."" [Contemporary reader slips into coma at this point]). Like a friend who admits to feeling like he's sold out when he listens to Top 40 radio after being exposed to the Canadian progressive rock group Rush, I had to wrestle with (apparently false) guilt at reading what felt like ""sci-fi lite."" But Crichton does a good job of showing how his ""What if?"" projections directly affect his three-dimensional characters. Granted, I could see some of the ""foreshadowed"" clues from a mile away, but Crichton's painting in wide strokes may explain why his novels adapt so easily to the movie format, which doesn't work effectively as often as you'd think. Crichton also pulls some completely unexpected surprises out of his hat in this story, as well. I discovered that Crichton's work is listed as ""Fiction,"" rather than ""Science Fiction,"" but hopefully that exposes his stories to a much wider audience, instead of relegating it to what some might call the SF ghetto. Some ""hard science"" advocates will no doubt find something to nitpick about, but I ""suspended my disbelief/And I was entertained"" (paraphrased, ""Mystic Rhythms,"" _Power Windows,_ Rush). A lot better than I'd hoped it would be, and a pretty easy read. Let's see what *else* young Mr. Crichton is up to...",5,0,0

"We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.",5,0,0
"I'm day by day amazed to realized how many people in this country still doesn't know what is MSG (Monosodium Glutamate) and the dangerous effects it poses to anyone's health. MSG INDUCES OBESITY: MSG is actually injected into laboratory rats to induce obesity. There are many many scientific studies done using these MSG treated rats since rats are not naturally overweight. It also has been shown to increase appetite in male rats and to induce obesity in female rats and chickens. Scientists in Spain have recently concluded that MSG when given to mice increase appetite by as much as 40%. CANCER: MSG AND CANCER There is evidence that suggests that MSG produced by any method causes or exacerbates cancer(1). At the same time, there is undeniable evidence that MSG manufactured using acid hydrolysis always contains carcinogenic mono and dichloro propanols(2-5) and that MSG produced when a Maillard reaction occurs, always contains carcinogenic heterocyclic amines(6). THE BACKGROUND Truly natural glutamic acid -- as it exists in its unadulterated form in nature -- is an acidic amino acid. It is found in abundance in both plant and animal protein where it is bound (tied) to other amino acids in chains. Manufactured glutamic acid (MSG) is different. It is produced commercially in manufacturing and/or chemical plants, and/or by fermentation. All processed free glutamic acid (MSG) - no matter how produced -- is neurotoxic (it eliminates brain cells) and is endocrine disrupting (damages the endocrine system) (7-8). In addition, all processed free glutamic acid (MSG) will cause adverse reactions ranging from feelings of mild discomfort or simple skin rash to such things as irritable bowel, asthma, migraine headache, mood swings, heart irregularities, asthma, seizures, and depression when the amount of MSG ingested exceeds a person's MSG-tolerance level(9). All processed free glutamic acid (MSG), no matter how produced, is accompanied by unwanted by-products of production referred to as impurities. Impurities are invariably produced by all methods used for breaking down protein (autolysis, enzymolysis, and acid hydrolysis)(2,6,10-15); by all methods used to produce monosodium glutamate; and by all methods use to produce reaction or processed flavors(6,10). Only the impurities associated with the MSG produced by acid hydrolysis and the Maillard reaction include cancer-causing substances. How do we know what we know? We know from the paper Regulatory status of maillard reactions flavors that Lawrence Lin presented in August 1992 at a meeting of the American Chemical Society(10). We know from the National Toxicology Program (NTP) of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Review of Toxicological Literature(4). And we know from the Codex Alimentarius Commission Position Paper on Chloropropanols(5). REFERENCES [1]. Blaylock R. (ed). Blaylock Wellness Report.

"I am a big fan of the high quality of Celestial Seasonings products and their usually good tea blends. This particular blend does not make the cut. I want to like it but somehow the coconut does not really work in this tea. The aroma is artificial coconut, and the flavor is a strange somewhat musty coconut flavor without noticable chai spice. Drinkable but an eccentric blend--perhaps a diehard coconut lover would find this appealing. Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.

My son is 3 1/2. petite for his age. The ad does not say this is an inflatable piece. He hasn't popped it (yet). He's used it twice to accent his buzz lightyear costume. The pack is an appropriate size for him. There are very thin elastic straps with short Velcro strips to wear it like a back pack. the problem is to actually wear it the jetpack can't be inflated complete. The Velcro straps are too small to hold. I am sure the design was meant to be small to hide the straps however this makes them difficult to stay shut & impossible for my son to put it on himself. He's an independent kiddo so this causes him some frustration. He's disappointed I can't inflate it completely for him to wear it. He calls it broken because the wings sag. There's no separate blow in for the top of the wings or the ends of the wings making it difficult to evenly inflate. Overall... it's a cute accessory but not worth the buy.

"If you are under forty, this DVD is not for you. I stopped buying Moody Blues albums back in the seventies (fossil hint) and it is only a couple of years after seeing this on the racks that I could decide that I definitely have to see what the lads are up to. If you have never invested (and that's an apt description) in a Moody Blues CD, start with Days of Future Passed and you'll truly see (even today) what all the commotion was about forty years ago. After that, slowly work your way forward. All the reviews are helpful. If your musical tastes start in the late seventies or eighties, and you have some knowledge of the groups later efforts (as well as I'm sure a thorough grasp of the early classic albums), I likewise wouldn't recommend it. Wait for a final effort that culminates your favorite later singles, at some future date.. This DVD is for aging original fans like myself who are surprised the group is still recording, (much less touring), and can't resist taking the band's pulse, even with Father Time so obviously in the wings. People like myself don't see the paunches, the gyrating back-up singers, the fill-in keyboardist straight from what was once a Carnaby Street pawnshop, but I assure you you younger viewers would. Having said that, here's my review for all the middle age magic students out there. The band (less, I'm sure you're aware, Mike Pinder) is in (ready?) good form. They're augmented by two keyboardists, two female backup vocalists and a back-up drummer to Graeme Edge (who really doesn't need him). And backing all this, of course, is the Colorado Symphony Orchestra which, except for a few wind-ups, is as good as any an orchestra the Moodies have ever used. I must mention this is my first visit of any sort to Red Rocks, Colorado, which, with it's symphony-holding grotto and huge, but quite democratic seating arrangement, is a really visually stunning backdrop to the concert although the whole musical presentation is somewhat cramped and produces similiarly cramped camera work. As one of the other reviewers pointed out, Justin Hayward was coping with a case of laryngitis, and his voice lacks that resonance that always made his vocals stand out, but he's never off-key or even strained in delivery. The concert is about equally divided between the early (up to Seventh Sojourn) and later work, with the middle section full tilt Moodies, with Lovely to See You, Gemini Dream, I Know You're Out There Somewhere, and The Voice, all full houses or better, slammed one after the other down on the stage. Later they played my one dissappointment of the concert, Isn't Life Strange, which I have concluded is strictly a lady's number. When they reach the refrain, ""It makes me want to cry, cry, cry, cry-y-y!"" I'm completely lost. Do you? Are you going to? Am I? Should I? It's the only song I ever heard them do that borders on the inane. But it's easily skipped with the remote, although as I said, the ladies would probably scream bloody murder. After a solid The Other Side of Life they close out the concert with another string of single smashes-I'm Just a Singer in a Rock-n-Roll Band, Nights in White Satin, Question, and, of course, Ride My See-Saw for the encore.

"At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.",3,1,0

"I was hoping for more here than what you find in the officially sanctioned ""iWork '09 Portable Genius"" books that Apple puts out. Perhaps something less propriety would have have been nice. But all I saw in this book was more of the same. There are more pictures, which are of some help, but because ""My Mac Book"" sticks solely to the Snow Leopard operating system, you won't even get help with things like the Pages word processor. Since IPhoto is part of iLife, you don't get any help there either. Exactly what do you get help with anyway? Oh, iCal (which is largely intuitive), making files, working with Mail, using AirPort, and, get this, MobileMe--which is a paid, subscription service. Shilling for MobileMe should not be in a basics book like this, but there you are. It also goes into detail with Genius on iTunes. Genius is another of Apple's little features that is really nothing more than enticement to buy more music. So, here again the book is pandering again to Apple's sales dept. Did I learn anything from this book? I wish I had. Most of it is so basic that I knew the ins and outs already. For the stuff that really had me stumped, such as a keychain disaster, it couldn't help me with at all. I found a fix somewhere else.

"This plush toy is undeniably adorable and wonderfully soft, making it initially appealing to both dogs and their owners. However, a major design flaw undermines its durability: the rear feet are constructed from a knit fabric, making them exceptionally vulnerable to tearing and destruction by dogs.

Opting for a more durable fabric like chenille in this area would greatly improve the toy's overall longevity and value.",3,0,1

"Worked great for a week. What a waste of $200 (I got the ""Mega""). ****update***** After my disaster with the Mega I broke down and bought the ""LitterRobot"" for $400 (I travel and an automated litterbox is a must, not an option). Extremely well built but the cats won't get near it. The kitten loves it but isn't heavy enough to ""trip"" it so I have to initiate the cycle myself (not handy when I'm gone). I saw the ""Plus"" version of the LitterMaid at Walmart for $88 and decided to give it a try. What a little dynamo. It's smaller than the Mega but it almost seems like the motor size was the same. Everything the Mega did was a struggle but in this smaller version it's doing great!!!! This has been a godsend. The ""Plus model"" can plow through anything. Takes up much less room (note to the LitterMaid designers- bigger may have sounded like a better sell but my cats only get in it one at a time). And if it goes out, at least it wasn't $200. This version gets FIVE STARS from me!",1,1,0

I think i should also mention that other than the bare spot on the trunk, the top of the tree has an excellent start on ramification. The tree comes in a very sturdy ceramic pot. If you are a bonsai enthusiast like myself, the pot that comes with the tree is only training quality, it is not a presentable display pot for showing off your work of art.

"This placemat has plenty to look at and is a great distraction for my 2 year old while I shovel food into his mouth. He loves pointing out the objects and then finding the little matching object along the border. We work on ""Big"" and ""Small"" that way. One thing he doesn't pay much attention to is the letters, and his fascination with letters on anything else is kind of why I chose this placemat! I think it's partly because there are both upper and lower case letters, and that idea is beyond him at the moment.

There is so much to look at on this placemat that he doesn't get bored, and we certainly don't need the TV on during meals!

"Quiddler is an exceptionally easy make-words game. It is good fun for families with pre-teen kids, and there is just enough to the game to enable the parents to enjoy the experience in the family group setting. But 3-4 adults playing with no kids would be bored by this game. Why play Quiddler when your kids could play BananaGrams with you instead? The game is like the Rummy card games, except there is no playing off the cards layed down by anyone (remember, Quiddler is simple, even simplistic). Unfortunately, there are no big point swings in who is winning vs losing. In Rummy games the leading player can get stuck with lots of penalty points in the next round. In theory that can happen in Quiddler, but in practice that is rare. The cards are of high physical quality, except for one problem: the point values printed on the letter cards are in an unnecessarily small font. This means that a person who benefits from reading glasses cannot play without the glasses. There was plenty of space on the cards to make the point values larger. A possible flaw in the rules is that the game sometimes motivates you to not want to form All your cards into words and succeed in getting rid of all your cards. In the few times we played, luckily we did not hit a case where every player was unwilling to end the round. The underlying cause of this flaw relates to my earlier comment that players rarely get stuck with several unplayable cards in their hand, for which they would suffer many penalty points. From this same company, their game SET is better.",3,1,0
"I was recently sent a set of Christmas specials in exchange for review, most of which I had never seen before. One of them was the stop motion classic Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town. Nope, I'd never even heard of it before, but I found it pretty fun. As the special opens, we run into a mail man (voiced by Fred Astaire) who is delivering letters to Santa. He decides to tell us all about Santa. It starts many years ago when a baby was left in the care of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (Paul Frees). Being the mean guy that he is, Burgermeister throws the baby out. But he winds up in the care of a family of elves named Kringle who happen to be toy makers. The baby grows into a man named Kris (Mickey Rooney) who decides to deliver the toys that his family makes to share the joy with kids everywhere. But when he returns to his home village, he finds that the Burgermeister Meisterburger has outlawed all toys. As a result of defying the ban, Kris becomes a wanted fugitive. Can he find a way to bring joy to the kids of the village? And what about the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn) who lives between the Kringles and the village? To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this special, and I'm not quite sure why. Maybe my low expectations were why this one surprised me so much. I actually got quite caught up in the story even though I had most of it figured out early. The characters were so great, too, from Kris to his adopted family and his love interest Jessica (Robie Lester) on the good side to the villain you love to hate, Burgermeister Meisterburger. I'm not a big fan of stop motion animation. It looks too jerky to me most of the time. That was certainly the case here, but I actually found it charming. Maybe I'm softening in my old age. One drawback to this short is the music. Outside of the title song (which Fred Astaire sings so well), all the songs were unfamiliar to me. Frankly, they didn't add much. In fact, I found myself wanting to fast forward through them to get back to the story. Not helping at all was how dated the musical segments were. This special was released in 1970, and it shows. I got a definite flower power vibe off the animation during the songs. There were a couple of other times I felt a bit of that crept into the story. You might also describe it as psychedelic. My roommate found this aspect even more annoying than I did; I was mostly able to ignore it and get lost in the story again when it was over. Kids, the target audience, won't notice how dated this is. In fact, they'll find the 50 minutes over all too quickly. Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town, and he's doing it with plenty of charm to entertain for years to come.",4,0,0

"I purchased this set, based on the reviews, as a gift for a young neice. Rather than just giftwrapping the box, I took the uke out, tuned it, retuned it, stretched the strings, retuned it. After 2 days, it would hold tune for about 3 minutes of playing (junk strings are probably to blame). I did all this because my neice would be a beginner and therefore be easily frustrated by an instrument that would not hold tune. Next I went to a ""learn to play"" site on the net and found C Am F G7 chord diagrams and started to attempt to play. The strings were so high off the fretboard that any note fingered above the 3rd fret would pull the string out of tune. The easy chords were difficult because the high strings got in the way of my fingers so that I could not finger a chord cleanly. With the intonation and tuning problems, I was not willing to give this instrument to my neice, so next I went to a local music store to see if a set of strings and some shaving of the saddle (the white peice on the bridge that the strings rest on) would make it playable. In order to gain a frame of reference, I picked up a $78 uke and strummed my newly learned chords. It sounded and played great! I told the music store guy that I wanted this uke to play like the $78 one. He said the the cost would equal the original cost and still might not produce a good instrument. Then he showed me a $40 instrument, an entry level uke from Kala or Lanakai. It played like the more expensive one, but didn't have the pretty binding, etc. I loved it and bought it. When I got home I called for an RMA and will send the much inferior Firebrand uke with all the books and cd's back to the seller. The sellers were nice and seemed concerned about selling an unplayable instrument. It's too close to Christmas to waste time on this one. Hope this helps you out.",1,1,0

"While the original Chronicles of Narnia remain timeless classics, beloved by readers of all ages, the new chronological editions feel like a misguided attempt to fix something that wasn't broken. C.S. Lewis's original publication order offers a unique reading experience, and rearranging these cherished stories diminishes the magic inherent in their carefully considered sequence. For seasoned Narnia enthusiasts, these editions offer little more than a jarring disruption to a well-loved tradition.",2,1,1
"My parents read Narnia to me when I was a child. I also watched the BBC version on VHS. It was a world so truthful, so engaging, and so magical, that it has an eternal nature for me. I don't feel as much that Lewis created Narnia, as found it. I've recently had the privilege of reading the series to a child in my life over the past three years. She's not as into it as I am, and she doesn't even remember the first half of the series anymore. We started when she was five and finished when she was eight. Sure, there's sexism and Christian influence and racism. Maybe this is part of the strength of the narrative, as we see these things reflected in our world as well. I don't think it's the ideal children's book, or the ideal story [with so much emphasis on war and conflict].",5,0,0

"As a first-time pressure cooker user, I found this model surprisingly easy to learn and operate. However, the design of the pressure regulator is a notable drawback. The loose, weighted regulator, which simply sits atop the vent, feels precarious and prone to being misplaced.

"This bluetooth headset performs admirably for those who have the ears that will fit. Experience has shown me however, that the fit is nearly the most important feature. It's a shame I had to return this nice headset. PROS: - Excellent sound quality on both ends - Good battery life - Good build quality - Multiple charging options - Good looks - Vibrating alert - Multipoint connection CONS: - Poor fit for some - Buttons hard to press - Shorter range than indicated - Poor instruction manual I have an old Logitech Mobile Freedom bluetooth headset I purchased nearly two years ago. With the upcoming law that prohibits the use of cell phones without hands-free devices, I needed a 2nd headset for our 2nd car. I figured I could leave a headset in each car and both my wife and I would always have a headset to use regardless of driver or car. I found out that my old headset does not support multiple pairings (Multipoint), but the Jabra BT5010 did. I was willing to use a specific headset per phone as the value of the BT5010 was worth the small inconvenience, but after a fair amount of use, had to return it. FIT This has to be the most important aspect of the headset, in my opinion. My old Logitech headset fit great, but did take some time to get used to. I was willing to give the BT5010 some time as well, but it never fit the way I felt was necessary. It basically only just hung on my ear. If I turned my head in either direction to check my blind spots, the headset literally flew off onto the floor. After flying off my ear a handful of times, I realized it was more dangerous for me to search for it on the floor board of my car than it was to just use my phone without it. It may fit some people's ears better, but I can't imagine who's. The hook is too rigid and short to properly loops around the ear and stay on. Poor design unfortunately. CALL QUALITY Due to the boom mic that slides out, my voice quality for the other person was excellent. I didn't try it with the windows down, but just driving my car around, I was told that they could not tell I was using a headset and sounded just as good as if I were not using a headset. I could also hear the other caller very well, even though the speaker did not rest entirely on my ear or rest in the ear canal. BATTERY & CHARGING It only took 2 hours to completely charge, which is half the time it takes for me to charge my Logitech headset. The battery life was more than enough for my use and the included USB charging cable was a fantastic added accessory. BUTTONS There are 4 buttons total, which is one more button than my Logitech. It has a volume up and volume down button, an answer/end button, and a dedicated power on/off/pairing button. I found the buttons were pretty difficult to use. They just do not depress very well and you must have a good grip on the headset in order to actuate them. Given that the headset did not fit terribly well on my ear, it didn't take much for me to have the headset fall off while I was adjusting the volume or trying to use the answer/end button. INSTRUCTIONS The manual is extremely basic and the quick start guide actually had incorrect directions. It took me about an hour to finally figure out how to get voice activation working, but could never get the hold function to work or turn off vibrating alert. MISC The BT5010 headset feels very well made and the sliding boom mic glides smoothly. I could only get an effective range of about 15 feet before static would overcome acceptable use. On the positive side, it paired very quickly when in range and never lost the pairing, as my Logitech often does. Also, whenever I activated voice commands, the volume would actually vibrate the headset on my ear to the point it became uncomfortable. I would lower the volume and it would still vibrate and I'd have to turn the volume back up to hear the caller once the call connected. SUMMARY I rarely buy tech items on impulse, but I did on this occasion because of the great price I found the BT5010 for. It was almost a great purchase because the call quality and features are what I hoped for in my next headset. Unfortunately, it wouldn't stay on my ear. And what would be the point of having a headset if it was on the ground?",3,1,0
"A disturbed, young British woman, known only as Grey, arrives in Tokyo after a long hospitalization in a psychiatric unit. She has been hoping for nine years to find a piece of film recording the Nanking Massacre in China by the Japanese in 1937, a massacre of 300,000 people, which the Japanese deny happened. Needing a very specific bit of information that she believes is in the film, Grey contacts Shi Chongming, an elderly Chinese professor at a Japanese university, whom she believes has the missing film. She eventually agrees to try to unearth information he wants about a life-saving medicine used by an ailing Japanese gangster in exchange for information about the Nanking film. Grey is a fragile and interesting character, bearing both physical and emotional scars, and when she is accepted as a hostess at the ""Some Like it Hot"" nightclub, run by the unforgettable Strawberry Nakatani, who believes herself a Marilyn Monroe look-alike, she meets the ailing gangster, Junzo Fuyuki. Other intriguing peripheral characters add to the drama: Jason, an American with a pre-occupation with death and a sexual fetish for ""weirdos"" like Grey; a pair of Russian twins, who are also hostesses; and Ogawa, the transvestite nurse of the gangster, who lurks in the background and acts as an enforcer. The various settings, especially that of a falling-down house occupied by Grey, Jason, and the Russian twins, showcase the bizarre characters and their actions. The point of view alternates between Grey, as she tries to gain control of her life by finding this mysterious film, and that of Shi Chongming, who recounts in painful detail his memories of the Japanese invasion of Nanking and the attempts that he and his wife Shujing make to to stay alive. The author's ability to present both internal action and external terror is admirable, creating both tension and heart-stopping suspense, though she does resort to obvious foreshadowing to keep the reader going: ""I knew that the answer I wanted was very nearby,"" for example, and ""I was sure, without knowing why, that just behind those blinds...."" The plot and characters are intriguing for the first two-thirds of the book. Then, as the exact nature of Grey's quest on behalf of Shi Chongming becomes clearer, the plot veers into stomach-turning sadism and perversion. Sensational deaths and ankle-deep gore increase as Grey's shocking ""crime,"" Fuyuki's pathology, and Shi Chongming's ""sin"" come together in dramatic fashion. Not for the faint of heart, this pop novel is nightmare-inducing, filled with pathological behavior and grotesque deaths, minutely described. (3.5 stars). Mary Whipple",4,1,0
